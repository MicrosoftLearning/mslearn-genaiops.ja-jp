# Automated evaluation with cloud evaluators

This exercise takes approximately **40 minutes**.

> **Note**: This lab assumes a pre-configured lab environment with Visual Studio Code, Azure CLI, and Python already installed.

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll use Microsoft Foundry's cloud evaluators to automatically assess quality at scale for the Adventure Works Trail Guide Agent. You'll run evaluations against a large test dataset (200 query-response pairs) to validate quality metrics and establish an automated evaluation pipeline for future changes.

**Scenario**: You're operating the Adventure Works Trail Guide Agent. You want to evaluate it against a large test dataset (200 query-response pairs) to validate quality metrics and establish an automated evaluation pipeline that can scale as your agent evolves.

You'll use the following evaluation criteria—automated at scale:

- **Intent Resolution**: Does the response fully address what the user asked?
- **Relevance**: Is the response appropriate and on-topic for the query?
- **Groundedness**: Are the claims factually accurate and based on domain knowledge?

## Set up the environment

To complete the tasks in this exercise, you need:

- Visual Studio Code
- Azure subscription with Microsoft Foundry access
- Git and [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- Python 3.9 or later
- Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI (azd) installed

> **Tip**: If you haven't installed these prerequisites yet, see [Lab 00: Prerequisites](00-prerequisites.md) for installation instructions and links.

All steps in this lab will be performed using Visual Studio Code and its integrated terminal.

### Create repository from template

You'll start by creating your own repository from the template to practice realistic workflows.

1. In a web browser, navigate to the template repository on [GitHub](https://github.com) at `https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-genaiops`.
1. Select **Use this template** > **Create a new repository**.
1. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `mslearn-genaiops`).
1. Set the repository to **Public** or **Private** based on your preference.
1. Select **Create repository**.

### Clone the repository in Visual Studio Code

After creating your repository, clone it to your local machine.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the Command Palette by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+P**.
1. Type **Git: Clone** and select it.
1. Enter your repository URL: `https://github.com/[your-username]/mslearn-genaiops.git`
1. Select a location on your local machine to clone the repository.
1. When prompted, select **Open** to open the cloned repository in VS Code.

### Deploy Microsoft Foundry resources

Now you'll use the Azure Developer CLI to deploy all required Azure resources.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open a terminal by selecting **Terminal** > **New Terminal** from the menu.

1. Authenticate with Azure Developer CLI:

    ```powershell
    azd auth login
    ```

    This opens a browser window for Azure authentication. Sign in with your Azure credentials.

1. Authenticate with Azure CLI:

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

    Sign in with your Azure credentials when prompted.

1. Provision resources:

    ```powershell
    azd up
    ```

    When prompted, provide:
    - **Environment name** (e.g., `dev`, `test`) - Used to name all resources
    - **Azure subscription** - Where resources will be created
    - **Location** - Azure region (recommended: Sweden Central)

    The command deploys the infrastructure from the `infra\` folder, creating:
    - **Resource Group** - Container for all resources
    - **Foundry (AI Services)** - The hub with access to models like GPT-4.1
    - **Foundry Project** - Your workspace for creating and managing prompts
    - **Log Analytics Workspace** - Collects logs and telemetry data
    - **Application Insights** - Monitors performance and usage

1. Create a `.env` file with the environment variables:

    ```powershell
    azd env get-values > .env
    ```

    This creates a `.env` file in your project root with all the provisioned resource information.

### Install Python dependencies

With your Azure resources deployed, install the required Python packages.

1. In the VS Code terminal, create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

    ```powershell
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This installs necessary dependencies including:
    - `azure-ai-projects` - SDK for working with AI Foundry
    - `azure-identity` - Azure authentication
    - `python-dotenv` - Load environment variables

1. Add the agent configuration to your `.env` file:

    Open the `.env` file in your repository root and add:

    ```
    AGENT_NAME=trail-guide
    MODEL_NAME=gpt-4.1
    ```

## Understand the evaluation workflow

Cloud evaluation follows a structured workflow:

```text
1. Prepare Dataset
   ↓
2. Define Evaluation Criteria (Evaluators)
   ↓
3. Create Evaluation Definition
   ↓
4. Run Evaluation against Dataset
   ↓
5. Poll for Completion
   ↓
6. Retrieve & Interpret Results
   ↓
7. Analyze and Document Findings
```

### Dataset preparation

The repository includes `data/trail_guide_evaluation_dataset.jsonl` with 200 pre-generated query-response pairs covering diverse hiking scenarios. Each entry includes:

- `query`: User question
- `response`: Agent-generated answer
- `ground_truth`: Reference answer for accuracy comparison

### Evaluators

You'll use Microsoft Foundry's built-in quality evaluators:

| Evaluator | Measures | Output | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Intent Resolution** | Query intent addressed | 1-5 score | Ensure user needs are met |
| **Relevance** | Response addresses query | 1-5 score | Validate query-response alignment |
| **Groundedness** | Factual accuracy | 1-5 score | Ensure reliable information |

All evaluators use GPT-4.1 as an LLM judge and return:

- **Score**: 1-5 scale (5 = excellent)
- **Label**: Pass/Fail based on threshold (default: 3)
- **Reason**: Explanation of the score
- **Threshold**: Configurable pass/fail cutoff

## Run cloud evaluation

### Verify the evaluation dataset

First, examine the prepared dataset structure.

1. View the first few entries in the dataset:

    ```powershell
    Get-Content data/trail_guide_evaluation_dataset.jsonl -Head 3
    ```

    Output:
    ```json
    {"query": "What essential gear do I need for a summer day hike?", "response": "For a summer day hike, essential gear includes: proper hiking boots with good ankle support, moisture-wicking clothing in layers, a daypack (20-30L), 2 liters of water, high-energy snacks, sun protection (hat, sunglasses, sunscreen SPF 30+), a basic first aid kit, map and compass or GPS device, headlamp with extra batteries, and a whistle for emergencies...", "ground_truth": "Essential day hike gear includes footwear, water, food, sun protection, navigation tools, first aid, and emergency supplies."}
    {"query": "How much water should I bring on a 5-mile hike?", "response": "For a 5-mile hike, plan to bring at least 1-2 liters of water...", "ground_truth": "Bring 1-2 liters of water for a 5-mile hike, adjusting for weather and terrain."}
    ```

1. Count total entries in the dataset:

    ```powershell
    (Get-Content data/trail_guide_evaluation_dataset.jsonl).Count
    ```

    Expected: 200 entries

### Understand the evaluation pipeline

The repository includes a complete evaluation script that handles the entire cloud evaluation workflow. This all-in-one approach simplifies both local execution and CI/CD automation.

**Script: Complete Evaluation** (`src/evaluators/evaluate_agent.py`)

The script performs all evaluation steps automatically:

1. **Upload Dataset** - Uploads the JSONL dataset to Microsoft Foundry
2. **Define Evaluation** - Creates evaluation definition with quality evaluators (Intent Resolution, Relevance, Groundedness)
3. **Run Evaluation** - Starts the cloud evaluation run
4. **Poll for Completion** - Waits for evaluation to complete (5-10 minutes for 200 items)
5. **Display Results** - Retrieves and shows scoring statistics

This single-script approach makes it easy to run evaluations both locally during development and automatically in CI/CD pipelines.

### Run cloud evaluation

Execute the complete evaluation pipeline with one command.

1. **Run the evaluation**

    Run the evaluation script to execute the complete evaluation pipeline:

    ```powershell
    python src/evaluators/evaluate_agent.py
    ```

    Expected output:

    ```

    ```

    > **Note**: Evaluation runtime varies based on dataset size and model capacity. 200 items typically takes 5-15 minutes.

### Automate with GitHub Actions

The evaluation script integrates seamlessly into GitHub Actions for automated PR evaluations.

1. **Configure GitHub Secrets**

    Add these secrets to your repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

    | Secret Name                    | Description                          | Example Value                    |
    |--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`              | Service principal client ID          | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-...`    |
    | `AZURE_TENANT_ID`              | Azure tenant ID                      | `87654321-4321-4321-4321-...`    |
    | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`        | Azure subscription ID                | `abcdef12-abcd-abcd-abcd-...`    |
    | `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`    | Microsoft Foundry project endpoint   | `https://...ai.azure.com/...`    |

    **Optional Variables:**
    - `MODEL_NAME`: Judge model deployment name (default: gpt-4.1)

1. **Enable automatic PR evaluations**

    The workflow is disabled by default. To enable automatic evaluation on pull requests:

    1. Open `.github/workflows/evaluate-agent.yml` in your repository
    2. Uncomment the `pull_request` trigger (lines 4-7):

        ```yaml
        on:
          pull_request:
            branches: [main]
            paths:
              - 'src/agents/trail_guide_agent/**'
          workflow_dispatch:
        ```

    3. Commit and push the change:

        ```powershell
        git add .github/workflows/evaluate-agent.yml
        git commit -m "Enable automated PR evaluations"
        git push origin main
        ```

    Now the workflow will run automatically whenever you modify agent code in a PR.

1. **Configure Azure authentication**

    Create a service principal with Foundry project access:

    ```powershell
    # Create service principal
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-agent-evaluator" `
      --role "Azure AI Developer" `
      --scopes /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspace> `
      --sdk-auth
    ```

    Configure federated identity for GitHub OIDC:

    ```powershell
    az ad app federated-credential create `
      --id <app-id> `
      --parameters '{
        "name": "github-actions",
        "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
        "subject": "repo:<your-org>/<your-repo>:ref:refs/heads/main",
        "audiences": ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
      }'
    ```

1. **Review the PR evaluation workflow**

    ```powershell
    code .github/workflows/evaluate-agent.yml
    ```

    The workflow:
    - Disabled by default (requires uncommenting the PR trigger)
    - Can be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch
    - Runs the complete evaluation script
    - Shows results in workflow logs
    - Comments results directly on the PR

1. **Test the workflow manually**

    Before enabling automatic PR evaluations, test the workflow manually:

    1. Go to your repository on GitHub
    2. Navigate to Actions → Evaluate Trail Guide Agent
    3. Click "Run workflow"
    4. Select the branch and run

    This tests the workflow without requiring a PR.

1. **Test with a PR (after enabling)**

    Push a change to an agent prompt and open a PR to trigger evaluation:

    ```powershell
    # Make a small change to test
    code src/agents/trail_guide_agent/prompts/v1_instructions.txt
    
    # Commit and push
    git add .
    git commit -m "test: Trigger evaluation workflow"
    git push origin main
    ```

1. **View results in PR**

    Once the workflow completes, a comment will be posted to your PR with:
    - Summary of evaluation scores
    - Pass rates for each criterion
    - Link to detailed results in Azure AI Foundry portal

    > **Note**: If you haven't enabled automatic PR evaluations, you can still manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab.

### Review results in Azure portal

Examine detailed evaluation results in the Foundry portal.

1. Open the Report URL printed in the script output in your browser.

1. In the Azure AI Foundry portal, view:
   - **Aggregate metrics**: Overall pass rates and score distributions
   - **Individual test results**: Score, label (pass/fail), and reasoning for each query-response pair
   - **Evaluator details**: How each evaluator scored each response

1. Filter results:
   - View only failed items (score < 3)
   - Sort by specific evaluators
   - Search for specific queries

1. Identify patterns:
   - Which types of queries score lowest?
   - Are there consistent reasoning themes in failures?
   - Do certain evaluators flag more issues than others?

### Analyze evaluation results

Document your findings and create an analysis report.

1. Create a results directory:

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path experiments/automated -Force
    New-Item -ItemType File -Path experiments/automated/evaluation_analysis.md
    ```

1. Add your evaluation analysis:

    ```markdown
    # Cloud Evaluation Analysis: Trail Guide Agent
    
    ## Evaluation Summary
    
    Evaluated: 200 test cases  
    Time: ~10 minutes  
    Scoring: GPT-4.1 as LLM judge (1-5 scale)
    
    | Evaluator | Average Score | Pass Rate | Assessment |
    |-----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
    | Intent Resolution | 4.52 | 96.0% | Excellent intent understanding |
    | Relevance | 4.41 | 95.5% | High query-response alignment |
    | Groundedness | 4.18 | 91.0% | Good factual accuracy |
    | **Average** | **4.37** | **94.2%** | **High Quality Overall** |
    
    ## Key Findings
    
    ### Strengths
    
    - High average scores across all quality dimensions (>4.0)
    - Excellent intent resolution shows queries are well understood
    - Strong relevance indicates appropriate query-response alignment
    - Pass rates above 90% demonstrate consistent quality
    
    ### Areas for Improvement
    
    - Groundedness slightly lower than other metrics (4.18)
    - Review failed cases (5-10%) to identify common patterns
    - Consider if certain query types need prompt refinement
    
    ### Failed Evaluations Analysis
    
    Review the 5-10% of responses that scored below threshold:
    
    - **Common failure patterns**: [Document patterns you observe]
    - **Query types affected**: [Identify if certain topics are problematic]
    - **Recommended improvements**: [Suggest prompt or agent changes]
    
    ## Automated Evaluation Benefits
    
    - **Scales** to hundreds/thousands of items efficiently
    - **Consistent** scoring criteria across all evaluations
    - **Fast** turnaround (10 minutes for 200 items)
    - **Repeatable** and trackable over time
    - **CI/CD ready** for integration into deployment pipelines
    - **Detailed reasoning** provided for each score
    
    ## Recommended Use Cases
    
    | Scenario | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
    |----------|---------------------|-----------|
    | Testing new prompts (50+ queries) | **Automated** | Scale, speed, consistency |
    | Continuous integration testing | **Automated** | Fast feedback in pipelines |
    | Baseline establishment | **Automated** | Quantifiable metrics at scale |
    | Production monitoring (ongoing) | **Automated** | Continuous quality tracking |
    | Investigating edge cases | **Manual review** | Deep dive into specific failures |
    
    ## Next Steps
    
    1. Use automated evaluation as primary quality gate for agent changes
    2. Set up automated evaluation in CI/CD pipeline
    3. Establish alerting thresholds (e.g., intent_resolution < 4.0 fails deployment)
    4. Schedule regular evaluations to track quality over time
    5. Investigate and address patterns in failed evaluations
    ```

1. Save the file and commit your analysis:

    ```powershell
    git add experiments/automated/
    git commit -m "Complete automated evaluation analysis"
    ```

## Compare evaluation configurations (Optional)

### Investigation goal

Explore how different evaluator configurations affect scoring and identify optimal thresholds for pass/fail decisions.

### Experiment with threshold adjustments

1. Modify `run_cloud_evaluation.py` to test different pass/fail thresholds.

1. Rerun evaluation with stricter thresholds (e.g., 4.0 instead of 3.0).

1. Document impact on pass rates and false positive/negative tradeoffs.

Create `experiments/automated/threshold_analysis.md` with:

- Pass rate comparison at different thresholds
- Recommendation for production threshold settings
- Justification based on risk tolerance

## Evaluate model comparison (Optional)

### Investigation goal

Compare evaluation results between GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini to understand quality-cost tradeoffs for your specific use case.

### Run evaluation on GPT-4.1-mini responses

1. Generate 200 responses from GPT-4.1-mini for the same queries.

1. Run cloud evaluation on both sets.

1. Compare quality scores to quantify the quality-cost tradeoff.

Create `experiments/automated/model_comparison.md` with:

- Side-by-side quality score comparison
- Cost analysis (estimate based on token usage)
- Validated recommendation: Which model for which use cases

## Troubleshooting

### Evaluation taking longer than expected

**Symptom**: Evaluation runs for 20+ minutes or appears stuck.

**Resolution**:
- Check Azure OpenAI quota and rate limits in Azure portal
- Reduce dataset size for initial testing (e.g., first 50 entries)
- Verify model deployment has sufficient capacity
- If timeout occurs, cancel and restart with smaller batch

### Authentication errors

**Symptom**: `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` errors.

**Resolution**:
- Run `az login` to refresh Azure credentials
- Verify you have **Azure AI User** role on the Foundry project
- Check `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` in `.env` file is correct and includes `/api/projects/<project>`

### Evaluator scoring seems inconsistent

**Symptom**: Automated scores differ significantly from expected manual scores.

**Resolution**:
- Review evaluator reasoning in Azure portal to understand scoring logic
- Check if query-response pairs have sufficient context for evaluation
- Verify `ground_truth` field provides appropriate factual reference
- Consider that LLM judges may prioritize different aspects than humans

### Rate limit errors during evaluation

**Symptom**: Evaluation fails with `429 Too Many Requests` errors.

**Resolution**:
- Check Azure OpenAI deployment tokens-per-minute (TPM) quota
- Increase quota in Azure portal if needed
- Split large datasets into smaller batches
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
